            ### Task:

            I have a Stack Overflow post that contains both text and code segments. Please analyze the post and extract only the API mentions from the text (ignore mentions in code). For each API mentioned in the text, provide output the following information:
            
            1. API Name
            2. Full API Name (e.g., including the module or library it belongs to)
            3. The sentence or context in which the API is mentioned
            
            Please provide the output in **JSON format**. Each API mention should be represented as a JSON object with the following fields:
            - `api_name`: The name of the API.
            - `full_api_name`: The full name of the API (including the library or module).
            - `context`: The sentence or context where the API is mentioned.

            **Input:**
            Text: In this case, where the DataFrame is long but not too wide, you can simply slice it:

            ### Task:
            You are provided with a Stack Overflow post where some API mentions are marked with special tags ("</BEGIN>" and "<END/>"), Additionally, for each API mention, you are given the processed API mention obtained by analyzing the code snippets in the Stack Overflow post and restoring the possible abbreviations and aliases of these mentions. These processed mentions can be used for reference, but they are not necessarily absolutely correct. 
            
            Your task is to refer the full name of these API mentions, including the module or library it belongs to, by analyzing its context within the Stack Overflow post and the processed API mentions. 
            
            ### Input Format:
            (1) The post text with API mentions marked using "</BEGIN>" and "<END/>" tags.
            (2) Processed API mention with code snippet for each API mention, provided in the order of appearance.
            
            ### Output Requirements:
            (1) Output the full name of each API mention in a list in order of appearance in the post, without any explanatory or introductory content!!!
            (2) The number of elements in the output list must be equal to the number of API mentions with special tags!!!

            ### Example

            **Input:**

            Post: "In this case, where the </BEGIN>DataFrame<END/> is long but not too wide, you can simply slice it. If it's both wide and long, I tend to use </BEGIN>.ix<END/>."

            Processed API mentions:
            1. 'pandas.DataFrame'
            2. 'pandas.DataFrame.ix'
            
            **Output:**
