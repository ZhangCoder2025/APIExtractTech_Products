        ### Task:
        You are provided with a sentence where some entities are marked with special tags ("</BEGIN>" and "<END/>"), while others are unmarked. Your task is to construct coreference chains for the entities of this sentence, based solely on the context provided within the sentence. Finally, output the coreference chains that include the marked entities.
        
        
        ### Output Requirements:
        Output the chains in JSON format, where each key represents a distinct coreference chain containing the related entities.
        
        

        ### Example 1
        **Input:**
        Sentence: "</BEGIN>Sarah<END/> visited the museum. She enjoyed the exhibits. Later, Sarah and her sister attended a workshop."
        
        **Output:**
        {{
        "Chain1": ["</BEGIN>Sarah<END/>", "She", "Sarah"]

        ### Example 2
        **Input:**
        Sentence: "The teacher said that </BEGIN>he<END/> would handle </BEGIN>it<END/> ."
        
        **Output:**

        ### Task:
        You will receive a sentence and the context in which it is located. You first need to limit yourself to this sentence without considering its context, and find the phrases in this sentence that meet the following conditions: the object it refers to is not explicitly described in the sentence. 
        
        Then, you need to give a detailed explanation of the referents of these phrases based on the context of the sentence.
